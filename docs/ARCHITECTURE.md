# Architecture

## Boundary

`full-stack-auditor` has two layers:

- Audit engine: deterministic TypeScript modules under `src/ingest`, `src/index`, `src/profile`, `src/learn`, `src/lens`, `src/seeders`, `src/audit`, `src/verify`, and `src/reports`.
- Pi integration: thin adapters under `src/llm/pi-ai.ts` and `src/pi/extension.ts`.
- Optional local fallbacks: `src/llm/codex-cli.ts` for authenticated Codex CLI environments and `src/llm/claude-code.ts` for authenticated Claude Code environments. These fallbacks do not route through pi-ai.

The audit engine should not depend on pi-coding-agent. This keeps batch runs, CI, web UI, RPC mode, and future coding-agent flows on the same underlying artifacts.

## Two Modes: Thin Agentic Hunt vs Staged Pipeline

The project has two audit drivers over a shared substrate (ingestion, sandbox, verification, reporting, project history, command-safety policy):

- `fsa hunt` (`src/agent/`) is the thin agentic mode. A provider-agnostic ReAct loop (`src/agent/loop.ts`) lets the model investigate through a small generic capability surface (`src/agent/tools.ts`) and durable cross-run memory (`src/agent/memory.ts`). The orchestrator (`src/agent/hunt.ts`) wires capability, persistence, and reporting around the model and maps whatever it proves into the same `RankedFinding`/`AuditSummary` artifacts.
- `fsa run` (`src/pipeline.ts`) is the staged pipeline described below.

The hunt mode follows one design rule: **the framework provides capabilities and guarantees, not strategy.** A component is justified only if it gives the model an affordance it physically lacks (read/search the repo, run an isolated local test, recall prior runs) or a guarantee the model cannot self-provide (execution-grounded confirmation, sandbox isolation, command safety, durable replayable state). It is removed, or demoted to an optional model-callable tool, if it merely tells the model what to look for or how to think. There is no failure-mode taxonomy, domain playbook, provenance adapter, or search schedule imposed on the agent; those belong to the staged pipeline. The intent is that hunt mode improves as the model improves, without framework changes.

The human priors the staged pipeline relies on are not deleted — they are demoted. The failure-mode taxonomy (`src/agents/registry.ts`) is exposed as the optional `known_bug_classes` tool: a reference library the model may consult or ignore, never an enforced vocabulary and never a cap on what it may report. The provenance adapters are exposed as the optional `dataflow` tool, which calls the same `extractAllProvenanceGraphs` (`src/provenance/all.ts`) the pipeline uses; facts are routing evidence only and never a finding. This preserves the engineering investment while flipping control to the model: a stronger model pulls these tools less, and no framework change is needed as models improve.

The single hard opinion the framework keeps in hunt mode: a claim is not a finding until a local test confirms it. `report_finding` reaches `confirmed-executable` only when it cites a `run_test` (`src/agent/tools.ts`) that actually passed — expected exit status plus model-declared success patterns observed in the sandboxed output. The framework checks the recorded test outcome; the model cannot upgrade a finding by assertion. All sandbox execution, command safety, file safety, and output redaction route through the shared `src/security/sandbox.ts` module, which the reproduction stage also uses.

Hunt runs write `hunt_transcript.json` (the replayable action/observation trace), `hunt_findings.json`, `hunt_test_runs.json`, `summary.json`, and per-finding disclosure reports. Durable per-target memory lives at `<out>/history/<target>/memory.jsonl`; the model decides what to `remember`, and the most relevant or most recent notes are surfaced at the next run's kickoff. Findings carry `failureMode: "autonomous"` because the agent is not constrained to a fixed bug vocabulary.

Project profile, source index, initialization learning notes, proof obligations, provenance graphs, dynamic lens packs, and optional local checklist seeders are planning and context mechanisms. They may propose audit questions and routing guidance, but they must not produce bug findings. Findings come only from model-backed audit trials.

`AuditorConfig.projectLearning` controls the model initialization stage. It is enabled by default for live runs and writes `project_learning.json`, a reviewable record of what the model learned from the loaded source, corpus, deterministic profile, and configured high-level scope before it proposes lenses or checklist items.

`AuditorConfig.localChecklistSeeders` controls whether deterministic seeders contribute checklist items. They are disabled by default and should be enabled only for dry-run coverage inspection or local regression tests. Source-discovery proof runs should leave them disabled so both checklist enumeration and audit findings come from model calls.

## Scope Modes And Baseline Exploration

`AuditorConfig.scopeMode` controls how configured and model-generated lens packs affect first-round enumeration:

- `augment`: the default. Lens packs are attention guidance, not boundaries. The enumerator still looks for high-impact source-backed bugs outside the supplied lenses, and a separate lens-free baseline pass reserves part of the first-round budget for broad exploration.
- `restrict`: lens packs and configured context are treated as the explicit audit boundary. Use this only for narrow authorized scopes where out-of-lens risks should not be searched or reported.

`AuditorConfig.baselineExplorationShare` controls the first-round budget reserved for the lens-free baseline pass in augment mode. This is a recall safeguard: a user can provide a narrow lens pack for emphasis without accidentally suppressing unrelated trust boundaries, entrypoints, or invariants visible in the loaded source.

The baseline pass is still model-backed enumeration, not a deterministic vulnerability detector. It can add checklist items, but findings still require audit trials and verification.

## High-Impact Follow-Up

The framework optimizes for serious bugs over raw finding volume. Aggregation adds an impact score to each model-backed finding using the assigned failure mode, model severity, confidence, and source-backed signals such as proof soundness, malicious-prover control, value or solvency impact, authorization/replay impact, bridge/oracle exposure, nullifiers, consensus integrity, and verified-statement integrity.

`AuditorConfig.highImpactVerification` is enabled by default. The verifier always processes the normal `--verify-top` ranked queue, then adds high-impact findings beyond that cap up to `AuditorConfig.highImpactMaxFindings`. This protects serious candidates from being dropped merely because an early model trial under-ranked severity or produced a lower hit rate than simpler issues.

Retry quality also affects coverage. Model errors, JSON parse errors, and no-finding trials that explicitly say they need more source context all mark the item as retryable. Resume mode removes those partial results and re-audits the affected round items instead of treating the failed trial as negative evidence.

For ZK and constraint-system findings, verification can switch into composition mode. Composition verification must trace the full chain from attacker-controlled witness or caller input, through assigned/internal cells, copy/equality/lookup/range relations, gate/selector/rotation coverage, caller or gadget composition, and the verified statement. A local gadget gap is not source-confirmed if the surrounding algorithm, caller dominance, complete-addition tail, selector schedule, equality copy, or regression test blocks the counterexample.

## Rounds vs Trials

The framework has two different repetition mechanisms:

- `rounds`: project exploration depth. Round 1 creates the initial checklist. Round 2 and later call a deepening agent that reads prior checklist coverage, audit observations, and ranked findings, then proposes only novel follow-up items.
- `trials`: per-item stochastic coverage. Each trial audits the same item independently so aggregation can use hit rate and confidence instead of trusting one sample.

This distinction is important. A stronger run should not merely repeat the same checklist. Later rounds must add new `(location, security property, failure mode)` coverage, and the pipeline rejects duplicates using the same normalized item key for all rounds. If a deepening round produces no new items, the run records the no-op and stops instead of replaying prior items.

The deepening stage is still a planning stage. It does not produce findings. It only expands the checklist with source-grounded questions for later audit agents.

`--resume-run <dir>` and `--resume-last` append additional rounds to an existing run. Resume mode loads prior `checklist.json`, `audit_results.json`, `lens_packs.json`, and `project_learning.json`, then starts at the next round number. If a run fails before writing cumulative `audit_results.json`, resume falls back to completed `round_<n>_audit_results.json` artifacts. If any round contains model errors, parse errors, or explicit needs-more-context trials, resume treats that round and later rounds as stale, drops their results, and re-audits the whole affected round. If a failed run already produced `round_<n>_deepening_items.json` for the next incomplete round, resume audits those pending items instead of spending another model call to regenerate them. In normal mode, `--rounds <n>` means "run n total rounds from scratch"; in resume mode, `--rounds <n>` means "append n more rounds."

Project history is the durable layer above single-run resume. `src/trace/history.ts` writes a per-target manifest and material index under `<out>/history/<target>/` by default. The manifest aggregates prior runs, findings, source files, failure modes, severity counts, and confirmation counts. The material index records sanitized pointers to reusable run artifacts such as project learning, dynamic lenses, source indexes, proof obligations, context retrieval traces, checklists, audit results, verification notes, reports, events, and model-call traces. `--continue-project <target>` resolves the latest run from this project history instead of relying on the global last-run pointer.

The deepening strategy is explicit:

- `breadth`: bounded breadth expansion across new modules, trust boundaries, invariants, and unexamined data-flow edges.
- `depth`: bounded depth expansion around top candidates and skeptical observations. It produces follow-up audit items that can confirm, refute, or narrow hypotheses through source tracing, caller/callee dominance checks, counterexample conditions, and local verification obligations.
- `hybrid`: the default. The planner splits each later-round item budget across breadth and depth branches, then deduplicates the combined item set. If prior findings exist, depth receives about half the budget. If no findings exist, breadth receives most of the budget while depth still gets a smaller near-miss analysis slice when enough budget is available.

This makes the default policy a beam-search style audit: keep expanding coverage while preserving a scored queue of promising hypotheses for deeper scrutiny. It avoids two failure modes: pure breadth that never proves anything deeply, and pure depth that overfits early false positives.

Near-miss analysis is a planning heuristic, not a detector. It queues no-findings that established only a local invariant, selector edge, caller/callee boundary, or adjacent flow, then asks the next planner to inspect the next source-backed edge. The model still has to produce and audit a novel checklist item before a finding exists.

## Agent Roles

- ProjectLearningAgent: reads loaded source and reference material, then writes source-backed planning notes without claiming vulnerabilities.
- LensDiscoveryAgent: reads the loaded project context and proposes dynamic lens packs for the target's assets, trust boundaries, invariants, attacker capabilities, and domain-specific failure modes.
- Enumerator: maps code locations, spec statements, security properties, and failure modes.
- DeepeningAgent: reads prior coverage and audit observations, then proposes novel follow-up checklist items for later rounds.
- MissingConstraintAuditor: checks whether a relied-on security property has a visible enforcement edge.
- BalanceIntegrityAuditor: checks conservation and turnstile boundaries.
- NullifierAuditor: checks uniqueness of spend markers and replay resistance.
- SpecMismatchAuditor: compares implementation and written spec line by line.
- ConsensusAuditor: checks ambiguity that could split implementations.
- VerificationAgent: refutes or confirms findings and writes local-only test scaffolds.
- ReproductionAgent: optionally writes a minimal local-only reproduction plan, creates tests in a copied workspace, and executes bounded local test commands when explicitly enabled.

Audit roles are declared in `src/agents/registry.ts`. Adding a new role should be a registry change plus tests and, when useful, a local checklist seeder.

The registry is extensible at runtime. `AuditorConfig.auditorAgents` accepts additional agent definitions, and their failure modes are merged into the enumeration prompt through `effectiveFailureModes`. The audit runner builds an agent registry for each run, so custom checklist items can route to custom guidance without changing built-in agents.

Project-specific customization has two layers:

- `projectContext`: human- or config-provided assets, attacker capabilities, trust boundaries, invariants, focus areas, and out-of-scope notes.
- `lensPacks`: scenario-specific failure modes, enumeration guidance, audit guidance, and optional auditor agents.

Live runs enable `projectLearning` and `dynamicLensDiscovery` by default. Project learning writes `project_learning.json`; lens discovery writes `lens_packs.json`. Both are normalized, bounded, reviewable planning artifacts, not findings.

## Proof Obligations and Provenance

The initialization path now extracts `proof_obligations.json` from loaded corpus, source text, model learning notes, and supported provenance adapters. Obligations are short source-backed properties that enumeration should turn into concrete audit items when visible implementation evidence exists. They are intentionally not vulnerability findings.

Supported provenance adapters emit machine-readable facts about how security-relevant values move through a framework or DSL. The Halo2 adapter writes `halo2_provenance_graph.json` with advice assignments, advice copies, equality constraints, equality-enabled columns, gate creation, gate queries, and selectors. The Solidity adapter writes `solidity_provenance_graph.json` with externally callable functions, external calls, delegatecall, state writes, authorization guards, signature checks, oracle reads, upgrade hooks, token transfers, and unchecked arithmetic. The Rust/Go ZK proof-orchestration adapter writes `zk-proof-orchestration_provenance_graph.json` with witness-source, task-statement, public-input metadata, recursive aggregation, and submit-proof verifier boundaries for zkVM/prover-coordinator systems. The Cairo/Starknet adapter writes `cairo-starknet_provenance_graph.json` with entrypoint, syscall, storage, L1/L2 message, class-hash, resource-accounting, block-context, and OS-output-commitment facts for Starknet contracts and OS code. These adapters make important routing and enforcement edges visible to the model even when a large source overview would otherwise truncate the relevant lines.

Portfolio enumeration consumes provenance graphs by domain. Halo2 graphs use assignment/dataflow portfolio prompts, Solidity graphs use EVM-specific prompts for public entrypoints, token/accounting flows, external calls, delegatecall/proxy paths, signatures, oracles, and unchecked arithmetic, and Cairo/Starknet graphs use Starknet-specific prompts for entrypoints, L1/L2 messages, syscall context, state commitments, class hashes, and resource accounting. Adding a new provenance adapter should include a domain-specific portfolio prompt when generic dataflow language would under-specify the attack surface.

The adapters do not encode "this is a bug" rules. They only create attention-routing facts and generic routing obligations. The model must still enumerate a concrete source-backed audit item, the audit stage must reason over the retrieved code, and verification must confirm or refute the candidate locally.

## Context Retrieval Quality

Audit prompts are intentionally bounded, so recall quality is part of audit correctness. The retrieval layer has two tiers:

- Deterministic `SourceIndex` retrieval is always enabled. It includes exact `file:line` ranges, semicolon-separated multi-file ranges, nearby source windows, same-file structural context, and referenced helper definitions found in the direct context.
- Optional `source-index+qmd` retrieval asks a locally installed QMD index for semantic matches and maps returned paths back to the already ingested source documents. QMD augments structural retrieval; it does not replace direct location or call-reference slices. Runs can pass `qmdCollections` or `--qmd-collection` to keep retrieval scoped to the target repository or corpus collection; this improves recall quality and avoids unrelated local collections.

Enumeration writes `round_<n>_enumeration_context_retrieval.json` before the model produces the checklist. The selected source slices come from proof-obligation references, provenance facts, and optional QMD probes, then the remaining budget is used for a broad source overview. This is designed to prevent important late-file or cross-file assignment and ingress edges from being dropped before the model has a chance to enumerate them.

Every non-dry audit round writes `round_<n>_context_retrieval.json`. Each entry records the item id, retrieval mode, included slices, line ranges, reasons, budgets, truncation status, QMD collection scope, and QMD availability or hit metadata. These traces are first-class debugging artifacts: if a model returns "needs more context", the next engineering step is to inspect whether the trace omitted the requested implementation, trait, constructor, test, or spec section.

Retrieval is not discovery evidence. It can only provide context to model-backed audit trials. A finding must still come from a model trial grounded in the retrieved source.

## Local Seeder Regression Gate

`npm run check:blind-discovery` runs the framework against a neutral fixture. The fixture does not name a target protocol, impact, or expected bug. The gate passes only if local checklist generation produces a generic missing-constraint audit item from source structure alone.

This legacy-named command is not a substitute for model discovery. Local checklist seeders prepare optional coverage; only model-backed learning, enumeration, and audit trials count as autonomous bug-discovery evidence.

## Pi Integration

The project is a pi package. `package.json` exposes:

- `src/pi/extension.ts` as an extension with audit tools.
- `skills/whitehat-auditor/SKILL.md` as operating instructions.
- `prompts/audit-target.md` as a reusable prompt template.

The extension registers read-only audit tools first. Tools that write tests or run commands should stay behind explicit user confirmation and sandbox guards.

The extension exposes both drivers: `fsa_hunt` for the thin agentic mode and `fsa_run_audit` for the staged pipeline. `fsa_hunt` requires a live provider and routes all local-test execution through the shared sandbox and command-safety policy; verification stays local-only.

`fsa_run_audit` defaults to dry-run so package users can inspect checklist generation before spending model calls. The extension also installs a guardrail on bash tool calls and direct user bash commands that combine public live networks with exploit/broadcast wording.

The command guardrail lives in `src/security/policy.ts` so non-pi integrations can reuse and test the same policy.

Model calls should use pi-ai providers by default. `provider=codex-cli` and `provider=claude-code` are explicit local CLI fallbacks for validation runs and should not replace pi package integration. The Claude Code fallback invokes Claude Code directly; it does not call Claude through pi. CLI fallbacks run in temporary non-interactive contexts with tool access disabled where supported. Individual provider failures are recorded as trial-level model errors so the run can finish and be resumed.

## Runnable Gates

- `npm run check`: strict TypeScript compile.
- `npm test`: build plus Node tests for JSON parsing, seeders, dry-run pipeline, mock end-to-end pipeline, and pi extension registration.
- `npm run dry-run`: local checklist seeder run against fixtures. It must produce zero findings.
- `npm run mock-run`: full model-shaped pipeline using deterministic mock LLM.
- `npm run check:blind-discovery`: local seeder regression for checklist enumeration.
- `npm run check:source-discovery -- --source <path>`: opt-in live model assertion that disables local checklist seeders by default, requires initialization learning, enumeration, and audit model calls, and requires a model-produced finding without committing that source.

Use `--rounds <n>` with the source-discovery gate when evaluating iterative deepening. Round artifacts must show that later coverage came from `deepen_round_<n>` model calls and survived duplicate filtering.

Use `--expect-location-line <n>` with `--expect-location-file-regex <regex>` when the oracle should accept a broader model-produced source range that contains the target line. Use `--run-dir <path>` to re-check an existing live run artifact without making new model calls.

## Local-Only Verification

Verification code must default to a local-only ladder:

1. Unit test against the isolated gadget/function.
2. Component test against the local protocol implementation.
3. End-to-end local regtest/devnet/forked-node test.

It must not generate or run live-network exploitation flows.

Findings carry a confirmation status:

- `suspected`: at least one model-backed audit trial reported a candidate.
- `confirmed-source`: the independent verifier confirmed the source reasoning.
- `confirmed-executable`: an optional local reproduction command matched its expected result and produced verifier-owned machine-checkable success patterns.

`AuditorConfig.reproductionMode` defaults to `off`, so normal hunting runs do not write PoC tests or run target project commands. `plan` asks the ReproductionAgent for a structured local-only plan. `execute` copies the configured source roots into `reproduction/<finding-id>/workspace`, writes only relative-path test files inside that workspace, scans generated files for remote URLs, subprocess spawning, and secret/RPC environment access, then runs structured local test commands with the shared command-safety policy. Executed commands receive a minimal workspace-local environment: `HOME`, temp, cache, Cargo, Go, and npm cache paths point inside the copied workspace, and local user, shell, credential, and Node option environment variables are not inherited.

Executable confirmation requires source-verifier-owned `executableSuccessPatterns`, short literal output substrings from the local command output. Matching an exit status alone is insufficient, and ReproductionAgent-only strings cannot upgrade a finding to executable confirmation, because a generic passing test or skipped test can otherwise be mistaken for exploitability proof. Strong plans should demonstrate the vulnerable condition on the original code and, when practical, the pass-after-fix condition on the minimal patch.

The CLI also exposes `fsa reproduce --run <dir> --source <paths...> --repro plan|execute` so PoC work can be batched after all potential bugs are found. This command reuses `summary.json`, `verifications.json`, and the same ReproductionAgent runner, then updates reports and confirmation status.
