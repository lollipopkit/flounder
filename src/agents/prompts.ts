Project profile:

Project context:

Active lens packs:

Enumerate concrete audit items. Each item must have:
- id: short slug
- location: file + line range or function/component
- securityProperty: invariant that must hold
- failureMode: one allowed tag
- why: why this spot is worth checking
- specRefs: optional list of cited spec/reference snippets
- attackerControlledInputs: optional list of inputs a malicious actor/prover controls

Prioritize issues that match the project profile and evidence in the loaded material. Consider implementation/spec mismatch, trust-boundary mistakes, under-constrained witness values, value conservation, replay or uniqueness failures, auth/session bugs, injection, SSRF, path traversal, deserialization, unsafe external calls, race conditions, consensus divergence, dependency trust, secret exposure, and cheap-to-trigger expensive work.

Return only a JSON array. No markdown fences.
