# Cairo And Starknet Audits

`configs/cairo-starknet-hunt.default.json` provides optional context for authorized Cairo and Starknet hunts, including Starknet OS, Cairo contracts, and StarkGate-style bridge components.

In hunt mode, the profile is context, not a checklist. The agent still decides what to read, suspect, test, and report. Deterministic profiles, provenance facts, source indexes, and local seeders are planning aids only; findings must come from the agent and local evidence.

## What The Profile Adds

- Cairo/Starknet project context for state transition correctness, OS output commitments, L1/L2 bridge messages, token accounting, class hashes, syscalls, resource accounting, and role or governance authority.
- Optional domain hints for entrypoint authority, L1/L2 bridge binding, state transition integrity, OS output commitment, syscall context binding, class-hash binding, and resource accounting.
- Cairo/Starknet provenance facts for entrypoints, syscalls, storage reads and writes, dict/state update flows, L1/L2 messages, class-hash binding, resource accounting, block context, and OS output commitments.

## Recommended Hunt

```bash
fsa hunt \
  --config ./configs/cairo-starknet-hunt.default.json \
  --target starknet-target-audit \
  --source <target>/src <target>/crates <target>/packages \
  --corpus <target>/README.md <target>/docs <target>/specs \
  --provider openai \
  --model gpt-5.5 \
  --thinking xhigh \
  --max-steps 60
```

For larger repositories, include the highest-signal specs, bridge message formats, OS design notes, prior audits, test suites, and threat-model material as corpus input.

## Local Reproduction

Reproduction is part of the hunt: the agent calls `bash` to run local tests in the copied workspace, and a finding only becomes `confirmed-executable` when a `purpose=confirm` test passes. Reproduction commands must stay inside local test runners, local fixtures, or isolated devnets. Do not use public mainnet or public testnet message sending, transaction broadcasting, exploit optimization, or credentialed infrastructure.

## Input Checklist

Load as much source-backed context as possible:

- Cairo contracts, Starknet OS Cairo files, generated interface files, Solidity L1 bridge contracts, and relevant Rust or Python harness code.
- `Scarb.toml`, `Scarb.lock`, compiler settings, contract manifests, and local test fixtures.
- Protocol specs, Starknet OS design docs, bridge message formats, bounty scope notes, prior audits, known limitations, and threat-model notes.
- Tests are coverage evidence, not proof that a property is enforced.

For high-stakes hunts, extend `projectContext` with exact bounty assets, public-network out-of-scope notes, privileged actor assumptions, bridge endpoints, token mappings, class-hash governance model, and local reproduction constraints.
